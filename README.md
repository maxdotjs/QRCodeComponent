## Overview
This was a challenge from [FrontEndMentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/qr-code-component-iux_sIO_H) where I tasked myself to build a QR Code page and have it look as close to the original design.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I got the chance to use CSS variables to create my own color variables used throughout the page. 

```css
:root{
    --white: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
    --light: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
    --grayish-blue: hsl(220, 15%, 55%);
    --dark-blue: hsl(218, 44%, 22%);
}
```

### Continued development

As for future development, I hope to do more animations in CSS and utilize the Canvas element. 

### Useful resources

- [A Complete Guide on Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This served as a perfect refresher for Flexbox and helped me center my divs and apply proper spacing between elements.
